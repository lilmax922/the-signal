## Application Building Context

Read the following files in order before implementing
or making any architectural decision:

1. `context/project-overview.md` — product definition,
   goals, features, and scope
2. `context/architecture.md` — system structure,
   boundaries, storage model, and invariants
3. `context/ui-context.md` — theme, colors, typography,
   and component conventions
4. `context/code-standards.md` — implementation rules
   and conventions
5. `context/ai-workflow-rules.md` — development workflow,
   scoping rules, and delivery approach
6. `context/progress-tracker.md` — current phase,
   completed work, open questions, and next steps

Update `context/progress-tracker.md` after each
meaningful implementation change.

If implementation changes the architecture, scope, or
standards documented in the context files, update the
relevant file before continuing.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
